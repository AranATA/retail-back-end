## description

***
This application aims to employ latest technologies and create the back end of an e-commerce website by modifying a starter code. It is working on Express.js API to use Sequelize and to interact with a MySQL database that is holding the data for the retailer.
<br>
<br>

## acceptance criteria

***

The codebase achieves the following criteria:<br>

* GIVEN a functional Express.js API:<br>
* WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file; THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize<br>
* WHEN I enter schema and seed commands; THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data<br>
* WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application; THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database<br>
* WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags; THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON<br>
* WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core; THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database<br>

<br>
<br>
